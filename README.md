# DS160_Final_Project_AJR-SEK
## Overall, for our project we wanted to see a correlation between the different contents of win and how it affects that wines quality. We used our own past experiences and knowledge on what affects food/drink taste to create our hypothesis and tested these hypotheses out using correlational coefficients after trainign our model.
### Final Project is our Coding Work, here you will fidn the code we used to do our linear regression, correlational work, and overall exploratory analysis
### Final Project Paper is our work report/paper, this is where you will fidn any pitfalls and difficult things, as well as our thought process while creating the code for our project
### Winequality-red.csv is our dataset, this will give you an idea of what we were working with, unchanged and as raw as when it was downloaded
